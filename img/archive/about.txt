I've spent the past two years thinking about what I wanted to do with this website.
To be completely honest, I've always known. I was too afraid to start. I've been
sitting on unfinished projects for the past two years, afraid I'd made a mistake.

This website is a testament to that,
This website is my portfolio,

Starting today, any thought, idea, concept, or any inspiration I find will be posted
here. I want to make things, good and bad, and I want to learn from that. I like writing,
you will be hearing a lot more from this website.
