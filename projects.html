                Filming the Total Solar Eclipse
            </div>
            Before the total solar eclipse, a couple of friends from college and I put together a
            weather balloon to catch some footage of the eclipse from space. We put together
            and sent up a weather balloon along with a GoPro and radio transmitter, to our
            surprise, we were able to track and find the Payload, from that we got this footage
            and telemetary data which you can view here.
